To Do:
 -

Notes:
 - ACTIONS and TILES are called by their class name but ITEMS are now called by their .name attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.

To Fix/Add:
 - How to update description of room or description of item if items are picked up from it?
   - Specifically, need to do this for Key Card in TCR, Note in TCR, plants in integration room, clocks in TCR,
 - Add buttons and dials to TCR (once I figure out what they will actually do)
 - Add emails to TCR scenario and also create
 - Add all 3 intro emails
