TODO:
 - Add main area descriptions (rough draft).
 - Add main area items and revise descriptions

To Fix/Add:
 - How to update description of room or description of item if items are picked up from it?
   - Specifically, need to do this for Key Card in TCR, Note in TCR, plants in integration room, clocks in TCR,
 - Add buttons and dials to TCR (once I figure out what they will actually do)
 - Add or complete the 3 emails in TCR scenario
 - Refactor code so you can import modules to items and have folders with files that hold different kinds

Notes:
 - ACTIONS and TILES are called by their "class name" but ITEMS are now called by their ".name" attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.
 - For the most part, in the main dome, the only time you can use cardinal directions to move is when you're in the
   hallways, in the courtyard, or in a room with multiple subrooms (hospital, security area, shopping area, and spiritual area)
   You can still go everywhere (that is portrayed as connected on the map) by using the enter <location> command.
