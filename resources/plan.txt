To Do:
 - Test APM terminal interaction
 - Add Key Card (for APM) to TCR (its already created, just add it and put it in description somewhere)
 - Add buttons, dials, photopropulsion apparatus, and note (with creds) to TCR.
 - Finish making objects in the opening rooms
 - Create opening rooms scenarios up to using apm terminal

Notes:
 - ACTIONS are called by their class name but ITEMS are now called by their .name attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.

To Fix:
 -
