To Do:
 - Update tcr description if note and items are picked up (add description_update module)
 - Add buttons, dials, photopropulsion apparatus to TCR.
 - Finish making objects in the opening rooms
 - Create opening rooms scenarios up to using apm terminal and test until thoroughly good.

Notes:
 - ACTIONS are called by their class name but ITEMS are now called by their .name attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.

To Fix:
 -
