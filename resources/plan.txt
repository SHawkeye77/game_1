To Do:
 - Have "name" attribute be a list instead of a string. So that any of those "names" can be called to reference the item
   - Be careful, though, that there's no overlap between names in the a room though.
 - Create opening rooms scenarios up to using apm terminal and test until thoroughly good.

Notes:
 - ACTIONS are called by their class name but ITEMS are now called by their .name attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.

To Fix/Add:
 - How to update description of room or description of item if items are picked up from it?
   - Specifically, need to do this for Key Card in TCR, Note in TCR,
 - Add buttons and dials to TCR (once I figure out what they will actually do)
