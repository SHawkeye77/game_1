TODO (by beginning of school year, hopefully):
 - Add main area items and revise descriptions (continue from shopping center, clockwise, then inwards)
 - Figure out how to update description of rooms or items if items are picked up from it.
    - Go through all rooms/items created thus far and implement this update.

To Fix/Add:
 - How to update description of room or description of item if items are picked up from it?
   - Specifically, need to do this for Key Card in TCR, Note in TCR, plants in integration room, clocks in TCR,
     items in the tile in the cafeteria, the TcsBookshelf item,
 - Could add pencil and paper so you could write notes on it and store it in your inventory
 - Add sound effects and/or music?
 - Add a carry limit (6 items?) Can be increased by a bag maybe?
 - Add the lore I skipped:
   - Add/complete the 3 emails in TCR scenario
   - Add buttons and dials to TCR (once I figure out what they will actually do)
 - Add action shortcuts
 - Have user input a name and make that the player name



Notes:
 - ACTIONS and TILES are called by their "class name" but ITEMS are now called by their ".name" attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.
 - For the most part, in the main dome, the only time you can use cardinal directions to move is when you're in the
   hallways, in the courtyard, or in a room with multiple subrooms (hospital, security area, shopping area, and spiritual area)
   You can still go everywhere (that is portrayed as connected on the map) by using the enter <location> command.

Ideas:
 - Could have some secret login you have to figure out that gives you info.
 - Maybe it turns out something that seems useless, like one of the jewelry pieces, ends up having a key or is a key and lets you in somewhere, or has some info, etc.
 - ELIZA chatbot in mental health room.
   - Just download the java version of eliza and do os.system(filename.java) then os.system(filename) to run it (I think?)


Notes from playing Zork:
- Make it so if it’s the first time you enter an area it prints description. Otherwise just prints name.
- Add action shortcuts
- Certain locations that change what you can do or the output.
- Zork seemed to have more rooms, less items
- Zork has weapons. Kind of makes you feel powerful when entering the unknown…
- They don’t provide a map, want you to make one as you go?
- Had choices of buttons that you didn’t know immediately what they did. You had to figure out and/or remember what they did
- Examine _______ doesn’t always return the a specific description of the item. Could sometimes have other clever stuff. E.g. in zork: examine mirror gives “an ugly person stares back at you”
- Use sound effects instead of just description sometimes.
    - Eg “press button” yields “click” instead of “you pressed the button”
