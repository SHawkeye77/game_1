TODO:
 - Add main area items and revise descriptions (continue from ____, clockwise)

To Fix/Add:
 - How to update description of room or description of item if items are picked up from it?
   - Specifically, need to do this for Key Card in TCR, Note in TCR, plants in integration room, clocks in TCR,
     items in the tile in the cafeteria
 - ELIZA chatbot in mental health room.
   - Just download the java version of eliza and do os.system(filename.java) then os.system(filename) to run it (I think?)
 - Add the lore I skipped:
   - Add/complete the 3 emails in TCR scenario
   - Add buttons and dials to TCR (once I figure out what they will actually do)


Notes:
 - ACTIONS and TILES are called by their "class name" but ITEMS are now called by their ".name" attribute in functions
 - The fake computer gui is 50 characters wide. It will look horrible if whatever is playing the game is less than that.
 - For the most part, in the main dome, the only time you can use cardinal directions to move is when you're in the
   hallways, in the courtyard, or in a room with multiple subrooms (hospital, security area, shopping area, and spiritual area)
   You can still go everywhere (that is portrayed as connected on the map) by using the enter <location> command.
