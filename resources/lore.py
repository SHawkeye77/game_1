    " you received the following message…\n"\
    "***\nDear Mr. Adams,\nOur Martian station has failed to provide their daily report for three days now." \
    " We understand this is not your main employment objective, but due to the pressing nature" \
    " of this issue and as an employee of the United Nations’ Extraterrestrial Expansion Association," \
    " we request your assistance in contacting our Martian-based communications director before" \
    " your allotted rest and integration period. We suspect the problem stems from a malfunction" \
    " with our transmitter’s photopropulsion apparatus, a problem, as you know, that is best handled by a team." \
    " It should not take longer than one work day. Thank you for your willingness to help.\n***" \
