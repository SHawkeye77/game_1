# game_1
Welcome to the github homepage for my text-based, interactive fiction game. 

## How to play

To play, you'll need python 3 installed as well as a cloned or downloaded copy of all the game project files. 

You'll also need to set your `PYTHONPATH`. This can be done by running the following command, assuming your current working directory is the top level of the game repository.
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
```

Once all of this is done, simply run the following to start playing:
```bash
python3 ./game_1/game.py
```
Enjoy :)
